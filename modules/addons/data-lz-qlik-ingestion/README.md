# data-lz-qlik-ingestion (optional add-on)

This folder is **only an example** of the "core + add-ons" approach.

It shows where Qlik ingestion infrastructure would live later (e.g., ADLS + private endpoints + DNS zone groups)
so the **core landing zone stays minimal**.

If you’re not implementing this now, you can safely delete:
- `modules/addons/data-lz-qlik-ingestion`
- `stacks/addons/qlik-ingestion`
